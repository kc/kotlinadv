    // methods:
    // How can we implement the functions pullEspressoShot and steamMilk?

    // One approach is to model these two functions as suspendible.
    // That way the caller will provide the input (type of milk or type of ground coffee beans)
    // and await the output (steamed milk or an espresso shot). But what about the internals of the espresso
    // machine? How does the espresso machine limit the number of espresso shots pulled at the same time?

    // What if we constructed two channels, one for the portafilter and one for the steam wand,
    // with a fixed buffer size of 2. We could then send the input to the appropriate channel.
    // Using the channel is a good way to communicate.
    // But setting the buffer size to 2 doesn't mean weâ€™re pulling two espresso shots at once.
    // Rather, it means we can have up to two pending espresso shot requests while pulling one

    // What if we create a channel for each portafilter. And similarly, we create a channel for
    // each steam wand. This is closer to what we want. We can launch a coroutine for each
    // portafilter and associate each portafilter with a channel. This is a good candidate for an actor.

    suspend fun pullEspressoShot(groundBeans: CoffeeBean.GroundBeans) = select<Espresso> {
        // select works a lot like a switch statement but for channels
        // select picks the first channel that is ready (here: portafilterOne or portafilterTwo)
        // By ready we mean this could be the first channel that is ready to send to
        // or ready to receive from. The select expression suspends if none of the channels are ready

        // We need a way to communicate the result from the portafilter actor back to the select statement.
        // This is why we create a channel:
        val channel = Channel<Espresso>()

        val req = PullEspressoShotRequest(groundBeans, channel)
        portafilterOne.onSend(req) {
            channel.receive() // returns the expresso from this portafilter
        }
